# Nailedit
### Nail·edit  or Nailed·it  ;)

Experimental code to generate string art based on an input image.

This is a moon shot project. Highly experimental and not well documented.
I just put it out here because people keep asking me about it and it may be helpful
to some to have a peek at it.

##### Requirements
* Python 3
* pyQt
* Pyside
* PIL
* Numpy & Scipy

The entry point is nailedit.py (surprise!). It uses parameters defined in the code but can also read them in from an external json file given as a command line argument.

Have fun!
